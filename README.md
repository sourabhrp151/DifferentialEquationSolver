# Non_Linear_Partial_Differential_Equation_Solver
This code currently can solve a non linear partial differential equation in C++ without external libraries. It uses Finite Discretization, Newton Raphson Method, and 7 different linear equation solvers (GaussJacobi, GaussSiedel,Successive Over Relaxation, LU_Decomposition, Gauss-Jordan, Conjugate-BiGradient Method, Tridiagonal SOlver).
